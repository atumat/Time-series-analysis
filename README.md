Time series data is everywhere, from financial markets and weather conditions to stock trading and server logs. My analysis explores a complete pipeline of time series analysis and forecasting using the three different ways:

Statistical Modeling

Machine Learning

Deep Learning

The project aims to give a modular, extensible, and practical foundation for time series projects in both academia and industry.
This repository contains implementations of deep learning models for time series analysis, including LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models. It focuses on forecasting tasks such as stock price prediction.

## Features
- Data preprocessing for time series data.
- Statistical and Deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, Transformers) for forecasting.
- Visualization tools for model performance.

## 🧮 Statistical Models

### ✅ ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- Captures autocorrelation in data
- Best for univariate, linear, stationary time series

### ✅ SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
- Extends ARIMA for seasonal trends

### ✅ GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)
- Models volatility in financial time series (e.g. stock returns)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

### 🔹 Feature Engineering
- Lag features
- Rolling mean/variance
- Date-based features (month, day, hour)

### 🔹 Models Used
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**

> These models work well when temporal patterns are captured through engineered features.

## 🤖 Deep Learning Models

### 🔸 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Retains long-range dependencies
- Effective in sequential and nonlinear data

### 🔸 GRU & Bi-LSTM
- Faster training with comparable accuracy
- Bidirectional context understanding
